Once completed, please copy your personal Adventure Game code into the `main.py` and paste your github link in this `README.md` in the section below. 

1. Create a new Repl called "Adventure Game"
2. Set up version control
3. Print out the introduction to your story, set the scene (from #1 on the Worksheet)
4. Create the variables (from #2 on the Worksheet)
5. Print out the user options (A --> E...Z) (from #6 on the Worksheet)
6. Create your while loop with condition while(True)
7. Inside the while loop, create "if-statements" for each option
8. For now, do not write any code inside of the "if statements" besides the print statement
9. Update the user input so that you do not get stuck with an infinite loop

*Ex*
```python

if(userOption == "A"): 
  print("You chose A")
if(userOption == "A"): 
  print("You chose A")
```

Give me a "reaction" when you are done with these tasks

If you have questions feel free to ask each other and work as a class
